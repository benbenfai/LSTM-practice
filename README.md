Tensorflow LSTM practice

This practice uses the LSTM method to predict a stock price. 
Use past 30 days price for reference and predict the following day price.

there are maltplot and tensorboard  visualising the result and value.

change stock by upload another csv file in your google drive

Change epoch size for different stock, as different data size

There is underfitting problem for this model
