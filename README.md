Tensorflow LSTM practice

This practice uses the LSTM method to predict a stock price. 
Use past 30 days price for reference and predict the following day price.
Dropout set 0.2 initially, yet facing serious under-fitting problem. 
Set to zero and get a bit improve. 

Finally, get the result, yet the under-fitting problem still here.
